### running locally

1. set up your own discord app, get the token and add it to .env, invite the bot to your server

2a. `cargo run --features embedded-postgres`

2b. or set up a local postgres server and provide it via DATABASE_URL .env var

the bot should add its slash commands to your server and you can interface with it as normal. the embedded-postgres provides an sqlite experience where you can run the bot in one file, but it is currently not persisted between runs. i think that's possible and may be added in the future
